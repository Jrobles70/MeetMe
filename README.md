# proj10-MeetMe

## Overview
This is my final project for CIS 322. This is still a work in progress and is a little rough around the edges. I struggled to finish this along with a few other large projects I had and honestly was not able to complete it. I essentially merged together my memos project with my busy times project to create an interface similar to memos but with meetings. I struggled to get everything working together and I am really dissatisfied with this project. I was not able to add the free times to the database for an unknown reason and I struggled passing information needed to view a meeting page. I realize that this will be my lowest graded project so I am hoping that my other projects show that I worked hard this term but dropped the ball a little bit at the end of the term.
